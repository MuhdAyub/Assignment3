Game installation files are frequently in an archive format such as ".ZIP" to minimise file size and make downloading the file from the game website easier.
You won't be able to install your game until you "unzip" the file and utilise the installation file that is contained therein. 
To do this, use archive software.

Step 1
Install archive software such as WinRAR or WinZip on your computer. 
To begin the download, go to the program's website and click "Download Now." 
Once the installation file has finished downloading, open it.
